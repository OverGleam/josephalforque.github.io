			<span class="position">Web Designer & Developer</span>
			<p>Hello, I'm Joseph Alforque, a 21-year-old residing at 131 A Tabada St, Mambaling, Cebu City. I am a passionate individual with dreams of becoming a skilled software developer and engineer. Technology is not just a career choice for me; it's a love that I cherish. My days are often filled with the rhythmic tapping of keys as I delve into the intricacies of coding.</p>
			<p>When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, you can find me enjoying the company of friends, sharing laughter and creating lasting memories. I am drawn to the dynamic world of computers and gadgets, where every line of code represents a possibility and every device holds the potential for innovation. As I navigate through the present, my eyes are firmly set on the future, envisioning a path where my passion for technology unfolds into a fulfilling and impactful career.</p>
